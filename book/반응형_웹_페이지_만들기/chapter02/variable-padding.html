        Domain-driven design (DDD) is the concept that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

        DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model.[1]

        Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

        placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
        basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
        initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
        Criticisms of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct. While domain-driven design provides benefits such as maintainability, Microsoft recommends it only for complex domains where the model provides clear benefits in formulating a common understanding of the domain.[2]

        The term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title.[3]
